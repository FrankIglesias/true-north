# Timezones App

## Client
- To start the client all you need is inside `client` folder run:
```bash
- npm install #This will install dependencies
- npm start
```
The server will run at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Server
The server runs with docker compose. So in order to run it you need to have it installed on your computer. [Instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To run the build and run containers just type inside `server`

```bash
docker-compose up
```
